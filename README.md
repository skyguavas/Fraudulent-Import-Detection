# Fraudulent-Import-Detection
🏆 Objective

This project was undertaken as part of the Korea Customs Service Data Science Competition. The primary goal was to develop a machine learning model to identify fake import declarations, contributing towards reducing fraudulent activities in import/export operations.

📅 Competition Subtasks

The competition involved three progressive subtasks:

- Subtask 1 (Data Preprocessing)

Score: 7/7 points

Focus: Preparing and cleaning the data for subsequent modeling stages.

- Subtask 2 (Model Training)

Score: 8/8 points

Focus: Training an initial model to perform well on the dataset, learning patterns of fraudulent declarations.

- Subtask 3 (Final Accuracy Measurement)

Based on relative Kaggle rank

Focus: Final evaluation of model accuracy, assessed on the Kaggle platform. Performance-based scoring was awarded up to 15 points, determined by relative accuracy.

💼 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
  
- Model training and evaluation on large datasets
  
- Accuracy optimization and ranking-based competition on Kaggle
